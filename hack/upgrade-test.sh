#
# Deploys the HCO cluster using the latest version in the git repo.
# This latest version deploys the hco-operator using the :latest tag 
# on quay.io.
#
# A new version, named 100.0.0, is then created. A new hco-operator
# image is created based off of the code in the current checkout.  
# A CSV and registry image is created for this version. The CSV
# uses the new hco-operator image in the hco deployment.
#
# Both the hco-operator image and new registry image is pushed
# to the local registry.
#
# The hco-catalogsource pod is then patched to use the new registry
# image.
#
# The subscription is checked to verify that it progresses
# to the new version. 
# 
# The hyperconverged-cluster deployment's image is also checked
# to verify that it is updated to the new operator image from 
# the local registry.
